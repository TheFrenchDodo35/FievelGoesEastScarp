**"Head up, eyes steady, heart open!"**

Introducing: Fievel (he/him)!  
Fievel found his way to East Scarp﻿ via boat, all the way from Gotoro! Can you help him make friends, turn his house into a home, and build his entrepreneurial confidence? If so, he may just reward you with something very special! 

ES' Fievel is an adaption of the character from Don Bluth's An American Tail, redesigned to be the same "species" as Hat Mouse and written to fit into Stardew's lore. Immersion-wise, he should fit comfortably into any East Scarp playthrough.
